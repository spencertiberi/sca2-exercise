# Guessing Game

## Overview

This repo contains a guessing game app! However, the game could use some re-tooling. We will refactor and add features.

## Spec

### To Add:

- Check if user has won
- A header giving a title to this page
- Styles to all elemets
- A way to request a new random number without reloading the page
  - Maybe a new button?
- A win streak counter that increments when the user gets a guess right
  - Should reset to 0 if the user loses
- Something to display to the screen when the user loses
- Any other features to spice up the game

### To Removes:

- Displaying the random value to the screen

## To Run

Run `npm i` to install all modules.

Run `npm start` to run the app on localhost:3000.

# Information about the Repo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
